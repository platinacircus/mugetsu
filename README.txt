Mugetsu - a faster Ruffle build for AdventureQuest Worlds
=======================================================

Newest version: https://github.com/mugetsu-aqw/mugetsu/releases/latest
(or double-click "Get the newest Mugetsu" in this folder)

What it is
----------
An UNOFFICIAL, modified build of Ruffle (the open-source Flash Player emulator, the same
player Artix's own Game Launcher uses). It plays AQW straight from Artix's servers
(game.aq.com) - no game files are included or changed.

The changes are all inside the player and make crowded rooms much smoother:
  - drawing work spread over all CPU cores; GPU effect layers sized to their content
  - avatar effects and glows drawn together on shared canvases instead of one by one
    (since 1.3: several times faster on laptops and built-in graphics)
  - much less work per frame in fights and when changing rooms
  - fixed memory leaks
  - smoother mouse handling and steadier frame pacing
  - fixes for crashes on AMD graphics and on graphics cards that run out of memory, and
    much less graphics memory used in heavy fights
It does not change gameplay, automate anything, or give any advantage.

Requirements
------------
  - Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
  - A graphics card with Vulkan support (NVIDIA GTX 600, AMD Radeon HD 7000, Intel 6th-gen
    Core or newer). On Intel and Qualcomm (Snapdragon) graphics, Mugetsu uses DirectX 12
    instead (their Vulkan drivers crash or show a black window on several chips); since
    version 1.1 it runs about as well as Vulkan. Without Vulkan, Mugetsu also uses
    DirectX 12 and tells you so. If a graphics driver crashes when Vulkan starts, Mugetsu
    says so, starts again on DirectX 12 and keeps using it on that PC (it tries Vulkan
    again after a graphics driver update).
    To choose yourself, right-click Mugetsu's title bar: Graphics: Automatic (recommended),
    Vulkan or DirectX 12. Mugetsu restarts with your choice and remembers it. Try DirectX 12
    if the game window stays black or stutters.
  - Graphics memory (VRAM): 2 GB minimum with Quality set to LOW in AQW's options, 4 GB or
    more recommended. Crowded rooms use a lot of graphics memory, and Medium/High need much
    more of it: on a 2 GB card, High can run out in busy rooms (the screen may go black or
    stutter until you switch to Low or change rooms).
  - RAM: 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended. Memory use grows the more rooms and players you
    see in one session (AQW keeps loaded items), plus what the graphics driver itself uses.
  - A CPU with AVX2 for Mugetsu.exe: Intel Core 4th generation ("Haswell", 2013) or newer,
    AMD Ryzen or newer. Older processors, and many Pentium/Celeron/Atom/Core i3 chips, lack
    it and Mugetsu.exe may not open on them (it can close without any message). On those PCs
    run Mugetsu-compat.exe, in the same folder: it needs only SSE4.2 (Intel Core i3/i5/i7
    from 2010, AMD FX or newer; for example the Core i3-2100) and may run slower.

How to use
----------
  1. Unzip the folder anywhere.
  2. Run Mugetsu.exe. The first time, Windows may show "Windows protected your PC"
     (SmartScreen) because the program isn't signed by a known publisher: click
     "More info", then "Run anyway".
  3. Log in as usual.
  Closing the game window closes everything.

  Settings: right-click anywhere on the game for Mugetsu's menu: Frame interpolation
  (smoother motion on strong PCs, off by default), Edge smoothing, Graphics, Show FPS,
  Full screen and Open log folder.

Safety and privacy
------------------
  - Nothing is installed and no admin rights are needed. Delete the folder to remove it.
  - Your login happens on AQW's own login screen, loaded from Artix's servers; Mugetsu
    never sees, stores or sends your password. It has no tracking or telemetry. Its only
    connections are to Artix's game servers; once on first start, to Cisco
    (ciscobinary.openh264.org) to download the free OpenH264 video decoder that Ruffle
    uses for in-game videos (checked against a fixed checksum before use); and once at
    startup, to GitHub to check whether there's a newer Mugetsu version (nothing about you
    is sent; it only shows a message, nothing is downloaded). To switch the check off, put
    an empty file named no-update-check next to Mugetsu.exe.
  - The log file contains no account details (no email, username or chat).
  - No Windows settings are changed. While it is open, Mugetsu runs at high priority and
    asks Windows not to slow it down for power saving.
  - Check your download against the SHA-256 checksum published with the release.

Low FPS on a laptop or older PC?
--------------------------------
  In AQW's Options, set Quality to LOW. Since 1.5.0, Medium and High cost much less than
  before on built-in graphics, but Low is still the fastest. AQW remembers the setting.
  When Mugetsu runs on built-in graphics with Quality on Medium or High and the game is
  clearly slow, it shows this tip once. It never changes the setting for you.
